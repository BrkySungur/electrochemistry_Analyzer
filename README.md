# Electrochemical Data Analyzer for Ivium
## Overview
The Electrochemical Data Analyzer for Ivium project aims to provide free and open-access analyzer algorithms, both as applications and source code. Electrochemical experiments often generate large amounts of data, such as extended charge-discharge cycles lasting several hours, or hundreds of consecutive cycles. This project seeks to offer software solutions to analyze such data, making it accessible to anyone interested in electrochemistry research or applications.
## Technologies Used
- Python: Used for developing the software.
- Flask, HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript: Used for building the application to run locally on computers.
